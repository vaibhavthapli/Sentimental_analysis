# Sentimental_analysis

Our data consists of 50000 comments. There are 25000 negative and 25000 positive  comments. Comments are of different lengths and are given in sentences.

Using the imdb dataset, we will train our LSTM model with positive and negative comments about movies. First, we will make comments available for the LSTM model. After training our model, we will examine the accuracy and loss values on the chart.
